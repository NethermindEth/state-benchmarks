"""Internal tx builder used by all 12 verb adapters.

This is a deliberate seam: it keeps adapter signatures uniform and replaces the EELS
scenario dispatch with equivalent, well-formed signed transactions. When the EELS port
(`execution-specs feat/spamoor-to-est`) becomes importable, each adapter can swap this
builder for the upstream helper with no change to the facade's public contract.

Every adapter obeys the deadline-bytes budget by packing until the next tx would push
the cumulative RLP size over the limit — at least one tx is always returned to ensure
forward progress.
